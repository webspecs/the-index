      <div class="p-summary">
        <p>
          The manner in which Web standards are developed today is often daunting to newcomers,
          most notably to Web developers whose input is sorely needed in order to build a better
          Web.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to fix this. The Web development community, and open source
          people in general, have over time developed work modes that are highly effective and
          can sustain both high quality and openness to contributions. There is no reason why such
          methods cannot be applied to open standards just as well, and that is what we endeavour to
          do.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is still the early days and pretty much every part of the system has rough edges — but
          every part is also being improved. If you want to join the fun, we welcome contributions
          on all aspects.

      <p>
        Specifications get added to this document through
        <a href="https://github.com/webspecs/the-index">pull requests</a>. If you wish to publish a
        fork of an existing specification, simply add an entry to the
        <code>&lt;script type="application/webspec+json"></code> block you will find in the source.
        The key to the object is structured as <code>username/reponame#branch</code>, and its value
        is an object with at least a <code>description</code> key. Keep it short and simple; as well
        as respectful of the other forks.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the <code>description</code> key, if your file name is not 
        <code>index.bs</code> (for Bikeshed) or <code>index.src.html</code> (for ReSpec) you can set
        the <code>fileName</code> field to the base name you are using (without the extension). Note
        however that this is <strong>strongly</strong> discouraged, and that the publication will
        always output to <code>index.html</code>. The feature is essentially available to
        repositories that have a pre-WebSpecs history and need to remain compatible with a previous
        setup for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are creating a new WebSpec from scratch (as opposed to forking one) then you will
        want to make a completely new section. Simply copy from an existing one and try to place
        it somewhere logical in the document.
      </p>
      <div class=example>
          Each specification listed here follows the same template outlined below.
          <pre>
&lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h3 id="example"&gt;The Example Spec&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    This specification is a permanent example of how a WebSpec is made.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;script type=&quot;application/webspec+json&quot;&gt;
  {
    "darobin/example-spec#with-toaster": {
        "description":  "Examples are always better with toasters. This part here explains what is special about the proposal."
    }
  , "sideshowbarker/example-spec#more-fun": {
        "description":  "This wasn't fun enough so I spruced it up."
    }
  }
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        When your PR is reviewed, in order to ensure that your fork is automatically published
        whenever you make changes to it you just need to create a Web hook in your GitHub repository
        that points to <code>http://publican.berjon.com/hook</code>. Once your PR is accepted, the
        WebSpecs index will be updated and your specification will be published (and republished
        automatically if you’ve got the hook setup).
