      <div class="p-summary">
        <p>
          The manner in which Web standards are developed today is often daunting to newcomers,
          most notably to Web developers whose input is sorely needed in order to build a better
          Web.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to fix this. The Web development community, and open source
          people in general, have over time developed work modes that are highly effective and
          can sustain both high quality and openness to contributions. There is no reason why such
          methods cannot be applied to open standards just as well, and that is what we endeavour to
          do.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is still the early days and pretty much every part of the system has rough edges — but
          every part is also being improved. If you want to join the fun, we welcome contributions
          on all aspects.

      <h2 id="how" class="no-num">How this works</h2>
      <p>
        Web Platform specifications an be available in one of three states:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>master</dt>
        <dd>
          For a given specification, the content of the master branch corresponds to technology that
          has been shown to be stable and interoperable, through testing. This does not mean that it
          is perfect. A specification can be merged into master whenever there are 1) roughly enough
          tests to get a good feel for how well something works, 2) roughly enough of them pass in a
          few implementations. These points are deliberately fuzzy. The idea is that there should not
          be a strict levels for any of those aspects as those tend to lead people to aim for the
          level rather than think about what's good for the project. This is meant to be a
          judgement call.
        </dd>
        <dt>develop</dt>
        <dd>
          The develop branch is the branch into which proposals are integrated, and which is then used
          to produce master when testing is sufficient. A proposal can be merged into develop when
          there is clear implementation interest (as exemplified by a couple of implementers starting
          actual work to support the proposal). As for master, merging a proposal into develop is
          meant to be a judgement call.
        </dd>
        <dt>proposals</dt>
        <dd>
          Here, anything goes. There can be many proposals for a given specification, and some might
          be completely crazy. That is okay, it is meant to be an area for creativity.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Specifications get added to this document through pull requests. The full approach is
        described in <a href='/docs/'>the project documentation</a>.

    This specification is a permanent example of how a WebSpec is made.
